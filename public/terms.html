						<br />
						<h4>These ActioPlus terms of use (“Terms”) govern your use of: a) the ActioPlus website(s) located at https://actioplus.co; b) the ActioPlus Program; and c) the ActioPlus mobile application made available by ActioPlus. The Program can also be accessed through approved third-party websites and applications (through "ActioPlus Partners"). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, the Program, Mobile Apps, and all related services provided by ActioPlus are referred to collectively herein as the "Services."
						Please review these Terms and the ActioPlus Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy"), which is incorporated herein by reference carefully, because they govern your use of the Services and include, among other things, AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
						All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Services in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors.

						<header>
							<h3>Agreement to Terms</h3>
							<p>Your permission to access and use ActioPlus’ Services is conditioned upon your agreement to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy, then you do not have permission to access or use the Services. By accessing or using the Services, or by clicking "accept" or “agree”, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
								We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. If you wish to use the Services in a way not authorized by these Terms, you must receive our permission prior to such use.
								​
							</p>
						</header>
						
						<header>
							<h3>Changes to Terms or Services</h3>
							<p>ActioPlus reserves the right to modify or terminate these Terms, at any time, without prior notice, and at ActioPlus' sole discretion. The modified version of the Terms (the "Modified Terms") shall be posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Services after ActioPlus has posted the Modified Terms shall constitute your consent to the Modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the Modified Terms, you may not access the Services and you must cease all access to and use of the Services and to terminate your Account (defined below). Because ActioPlus' Services continue to evolve over time, ActioPlus may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services. ActioPlus reserves the right to make such changes or discontinuations at any time, without prior notice, and at our sole discretion.</p>
						</header>
						
						<header>
							<h3>Who May Use the Services</h3>
							<p>You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older, are a resident of the United States, and not barred from using the Services by applicable law. You may not use our Services in any jurisdiction where offering, accessing or using our Services would be illegal or unlawful. The Services are maintained for the benefit and participation of individual Account holders (each a "Member") only, and each Member may maintain only one Account. Duplicate Accounts will be subject to cancellation.
								​
							</p>
						</header>
						<header>
							<h3>Account Registration</h3>
							<p>If you want to use certain features of the Services, you must create an ActioPlus account (an "Account"). You can do this via the Site, through many of our ActioPlus Partners' websites and applications, and through certain third-party social-networking services, such as Facebook or Twitter (certain "SNS Accounts"). If you choose the SNS Account option, ActioPlus will create your Account by extracting certain personal information from your SNS Account, such as your name, email address, and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit ActioPlus to access. By granting ActioPlus access to any SNS Account, you authorize us to access, make available and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your SNS Account (“SNS Content“) depending upon the privacy settings you have set within such SNS Account. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content will be considered to be User Content for all purposes of these Terms. Your relationship with the third-party providers associated with your SNS Accounts is governed solely by your agreements with such third-parties. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your SNS Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your SNS Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable SNS Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or subjecting ActioPlus to any usage limitations imposed by such third parties.
								You must provide ActioPlus with accurate, complete, and up-to- date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete, and up-to- date. ActioPlus reserves the right and may choose to suspend or terminate your Account if you create more than one Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms. As part of the Services, you may have the option to connect certain third party devices or applications to your Account. You agree to only connect your devices and applications, and not those of any other individual. If you connect such device or application, the collection, use, and disclosure of data from such device or application is governed by our Privacy Policy. You agree not to disclose your Account password to anyone and you will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You will be responsible for all access and activity that occurs through your Account, whether you know of or have authorized such activity.
							</p>
						</header>
						<header>
							<h3>Program Participation</h3>
							<p>Program Rules. Accounts, memberships in the Program, and promotions, benefits, awards, and rewards provided there under (and "Program Benefits") are offered at the discretion of ActioPlus and its affiliates, and ActioPlus has the right to terminate your Account, the Program, and any Program Benefits, and to change any terms, conditions of participation, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures that ActioPlus adopts to govern the Program or Program Benefits (any "Program Rules"), in whole or in part, at any time, without notice, even though such changes may affect the value of Program Benefits or program points obtained through use of the Services (or "Program Points") already accumulated. You are responsible for remaining knowledgeable as to the Program Rules which are published on the Site. ActioPlus may, among other things, withdraw, limit, modify, or cancel any Program Benefits, increase the Program Points required for any Program Benefits, and modify or regulate the transferability of any Program Benefits. In accumulating Program Points, you may not rely upon the continued availability of a Program Benefit and you may not be able to obtain all offered Program Benefits.
								Compliance with Program Rules. Participation in the Program is subject to any Program Rules that ActioPlus may, at its sole discretion, adopt from time to time. ActioPlus has the sole right to interpret and apply the Program Rules. Any failure to follow Program Rules, abuse of the Program, or misrepresentation of any information furnished to ActioPlus or ActioPlus Partners by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your Account and the cancellation of accrued Program Rewards.
								​
								Rewards. The Program is generally structured to permit you to exchange Program Fitness Challenges for Rewards. The accumulation of Fitness Challenges completed and the redemption of such Rewards are subject to the specific Program Rules enacted by ActioPlus. You are responsible for reading the materials made available to you regarding the Program, Program Rules, and Program Benefits in order to understand your rights and responsibilities under the Program. Only Members are eligible to accrue Rewards in the Program by availing themselves of the means of accrual recognized under the Program. A member may not accrue Rewards for the utilization of the Services by any other person, animal, object, or entity. Rewards can only be accrued through methods of accrual offered after your creation of an Account.
							</p>
						</header>
						<header>
							<h3>If ActioPlus improperly denies you an accrual of Rewards, ActioPlus' sole liability will be limited to the equivalent of those Rewards.</h3>
							<p>ActioPlus reserves the right to make Rewards and promotional offers selectively available to certain Members, at any time, based upon geographic locations, Program participation, or other factors determined at ActioPlus' sole discretion. You are responsible for ensuring that your Rewards are properly credited. Rewards in your Account will be maintained until those Rewards are redeemed or your Account is terminated, or the Rewards expire pursuant to the Program Rules, whichever occurs first. The accumulation of Rewards does not entitle you to any vested rights with respect to Program Benefits or the Program.
								​
								Audit Rights. ActioPlus reserves the rights to audit any and all Accounts at any time and without notice for compliance with the Program Rules. In the event such an audit reveals discrepancies or possible violations, the processing of Program Benefit redemption requests may be delayed pending completion of the audit.
								Prohibition on Transfer of Program Points and Program Benefits. No Program Points or Program Benefits earned or granted under the Program may be transferred or assigned except as expressly permitted by ActioPlus in writing. Accrued Program Points do not constitute property of the member. Neither accrued Program Points nor accrued Program Benefits are transferable (i) upon death, (ii) as part of a domestic relations matter, or (iii) otherwise by operation of law. The sale or barter of any Program Points or Program Benefits, other than as authorized by ActioPlus in writing, is expressly prohibited. Any Program Points or Program Benefits that are transferred, assigned, or sold in violation of the Program Rules may be confiscated or cancelled. The use of Program Points or Program Benefits that have been acquired by purchase, barter, or other conduct in violation of the Program Rules may result in Account termination and cancellation of accrued Program Points and Program Benefits.
								Program Partners. Some Program Benefits are provided by sponsors and promotion partners of ActioPlus. These partners are independent entities and ActioPlus is not responsible for the nature or quality of products or services provided by those partners. ActioPlus shall have no liability for withdrawal from the Program by such partners or for Program Benefit changes or cancellations caused by such partner withdrawals, or discontinued service by partners.
